            <p>Msakhan is often considered the national dish of Palestine! It’s a beautiful and bright dish plated on bread with lots of caramelized onions and chicken seasoned heavily with sumac. It not only gives it a beautiful color but also a tangy taste that balances with the sweetness of the onions so well!</p>

            <p>If you scroll down to the recipe, you’ll see it calls for a hefty amount of olive oil. Palestine is home to century-old olive trees which is why they produce some of the best olive oil you’ll ever have. Here is a statement from a Palestinian:</p>

            <p class="quote">When the Palestinians get the fresh pressed olive oil from their olive trees, it is traditional for many Palestinian families to make Musakhan since it is made with a lot of olive oil. Olive oil season is typically in October.</p>
            <p>There is also a famous quote from Mahmoud Darwish:</p>

            <p class="quote">If the Olive Trees knew the hands that planted them, their oil would become tears”– Mahmoud Darwish</p>

            <p>Olive trees actually contribute to 14% of Palestine’s economy and it’s not only used for food purposes but even beauty like creating soap bars. Many of the olive trees in Palestine date prior to Israeli occupation so they are a symbol of the resistance. Israeli authorities have been destroying olive trees for years, oftentimes burning them to the ground, restricting access for families to their farmland, and even blocking water to olive trees. A lot of times these attacks even happen during peak harvest season. This is a very similar tactic used against Native Americans by killing buffalos. To read more about Palestinian olive trees, <a href="https://yris.yira.org/column/israels-campaign-against-on-palestinian-olive-trees/">check out this article here</a> from the Yale Review of International Studies.</p>

            <p>So many Palestinian dishes are centered around olive oil since as you can see, olive trees are a huge part of their identity. Msakhan is one of those dishes packed with olive oil and is commonly made at the same time olive trees are in season. It starts with a flatbread called taboon. Onions are then caramelized for almost an hour with lots of sumac to give it a tangy taste and beautiful pinkish-purple color. The caramelized onions are slathered on the bread and topped off with roasted chicken. It’s definitely a more complex dish so there have been a lot more modern methods of making it that have emerged like msakhan rolls.</p>

                        <li>Transfer the dough to an oiled bowl and cover with saran wrap and then a warm damp towel. Place in a warm place until double in size, about 1 hour to an hour and a half.</li>
