                <h2>Fatteh</h2>
                <h3>فتّة</h3>
                    <p>The true breakfast of champions, Fatteh (meaning <i>"crushed"</i> or <i>"crumbs"</i>) is a Palestinian breakfast dish consisting of layers of fried pita bread, spiced chickpeas, hummus, toasted nuts &#40;pine nuts or almonds&#41;, and meat. Regional variations may swap hummus for tahini or garlicky yogurt. My father and I will usually put all the ingredients together in a large bowl, hand everyone a spoon, and we all dig in!</p>

                <h2>Ka'ak al Quds</h2>
                <h3>كعك القدس</h3>
                    <p>Also known as Jerusalem bread, or Palestinian bagels, is a fluffy ring shaped bread covered in a sesame seed crust -- often paired with zaatar to make a filling breakfast. This bread is considered a unique specialty good, so whenever we visit the Old City we get several loaves to share with the whole family. Ka'ak can also be sweet, stuffed with date paste or walnuts, but my family and I prefer it savory.</p>

                <h2>Kousa Mahshi</h2>
                <h3>كوسا محشي</h3>
                    <p>Translating to <i>"stuffed squash"</i>, Kousa Mahshi consists of hollowed out kousa squash &#40;similar to zucchini&#41; that is stuffed with rice and ground meat and simmered in a tomato base broth until tender. The Kousa is traditionally layered with sliced potato and beef along with whole cloves of garlic. Cooking this dish is a whole family affair, with each person taking on a different part of the process from coring the squash, to stuffing it, to assembling it in the pot -- making it perfect for get-togethers or the holidays</p>

                <h2>Mansaf</h2>
                <h3>منسف</h3>
                    <p>My favorite dish in the entire world, Mansaf is the national dish of Jordan and very popular in cities like Nablus and Galilee. Its name comes from the term <i>large tray</i>, as it is traditionally served on a large platter with a bed of bread and rice, topped with tender lamb, and a tangy sauce made with a fermented yogurt called Jameed. Mansaf is traditionally eaten with one's right hand, taking a bit of rice and meat, forming it into a ball, and popping it in the mouth with the thumb. This dish was created during the English occupation of Jordan. As the British did not mix their meat and dairy, this was one of the only foods they would not steal from the native people. I find myself filled with pride by the resilience and creativity of my people.</p>

                <h2>Maqluba</h2>
                <h3>مقلوبة</h3>
                    <p>Translating to <i>upside-down</i> in Arabic, Maqluba is a one-pot dish made with layers of rice, vegetables, and meat. The dish is cooked in a pot, then ceremoniously flipped upside down onto a serving platter, so the rice is on the bottom and the meat and vegetables are on top. The dish is a staple in Palestinian cuisine -- dating back to the 13th century -- and has strong ties to the Palestinian resistance. This dish was used by Palestinian women as a way to encourage participation in protests at Al-Aqsa, with many being arrested in the process. Everytime I eat this, I am reminded of the significance of my culture, how our mere existence is resistance.</p>

                <h2>Musakhan</h2>
                <h3>مسخّن</h3>
                    <p>Musakhan, translating to<i>something that is heated</i> is a dish composed of taboon bread topped with roasted chicken and cooked onion seaoned mainly with a deep red spice called sumac. This is the national dish of Palestine, known for its tangy flavor and rich texture. This dish is also eaten with the hands, in a "roll and tear" manner. In 2010, the largest ever dish of musakhan was made in Ramallah, Palestine -- made by 40 Palestinian chefs and weighing 1,350 kg -- using only Palestinian made products as a way to signal to the world the people's demand for ownership over their natural resources (mainly olive oil, the dish's most important component).</p>
