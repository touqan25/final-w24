        <div>
            <h2>Afritada</h2>
                <p>This dish is a hearty, tomato based stew that my family makes with chicken, potatoes, tomatoes, carrots, bell peppers, and onion. Served over rice, this dish is amazing year round. Personally though, I think it's best when you need some food to warm you up and leave you feeling full and satisfied. One trick that is helpful to decrease the cooking time is to microwave the potatoes or to boil them before adding the tomato paste, since the acidity from the tomatoes makes it take longer to break down the starches!</p>

            <h2>Chicken Adobo</h2>
                <p>As the quintessential Filipino food dish, this is the dish that most people know and think of even if they only know of one Filipino food. This is my family's rendition that I've grown up with and learned how to make from my mom and lola (grandma). Like many other great foods, this is ALWAYS better after sitting and resting until the next day. It's a simple dish that's great for meal prep or quick dinners.</p>

        <div>
            <h2>Chicken Arroz Caldo</h2>
                <p>This is a staple cozy winter dish! Translated to chicken rice porridge, I think this dish is best enjoyed after a long day in the cold. I have vivid memories of shoveling with my dad and playing in the snow with my siblings and coming inside to a piping hot bowl of Arroz Caldo. It's also fantastic for meal prep since it keeps well, it's simple, and can be kept warm in a thermos or reheated.</p>

            <img src="images/Tinola.webp" alt="Chicken Tinola">
        </div>
        <div>
            <h2>Chicken Tinola</h2>
                <p>This chicken ginger stew is amazing for getting good value out of a rotisserie chicken. Growing up, my parents would buy rotisserie chicken from Costco, and after eating some of it they'd use the rest to make this dish. The simple broth has such a well-balanced flavor, and my favorite way to eat this is with a large portion of white rice that's been adequately drowned in a bowl. Since it's hard to find chayote (filipino green papaya), I usually make this with greens or any green veggies from the fridge.</p>

            <img src="images/lumpia.jpg" alt="Lumpia">
        </div>
        <div>
            <h2>Lumpia</h2>
                <p>Lumpia is a special dish that takes a lot of effort but is incredibly worth the time, energy, and patience. Lumpia is an eggroll with a crunchy, paper-thin golden exterior that is typically filled with meat, but can be made with tofu and vegetables as well. Rolling them takes practice and persistence, and then they are typically deep fried, air frying or baking are alternatives in a pinch.</p>

        </div>
        <div>
            <h2>Mechado</h2>
                <p>Mechado is almost the beef equivalent of Afritada, but cooked with beef. Using beef, carrots, potato, bell peppers, tomato and lemon or calamansi (filipino lime) gives this dish a mix of hearty flavor and tartness that's distinct from Afritada. I would recommend beef chuck as the ideal cut of meat for this dish. In addition to being cost effective, it works well in this stew.</p>
