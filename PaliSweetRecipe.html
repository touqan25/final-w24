        <h3>Directions</h3>
        <div>
            <div>
                <h4>Make the Ashta</h4>
                    <ol>
                        <li>To a small pot over medium heat, add the heavy cream, milk, sugar, cornstarch, all-purpose flour, and vanilla extract.</li>
                        <li>Whisk continuously and bring to a boil. Once bubbling, reduce the heat, bring to a simmer, and continuously whisk so it doesn't become clumpy until it thickens up.</li>
                        <li>Once thick, transfer to a bowl and cover the top with Saran Wrap, making sure it's touching the cream. Transfer to the fridge to cool down.</li>
                        <li>When it cools, add the crumbled sweet cheese to the ashta and mix it all together. Set aside.</li>

                    </ol>
                </div>
            <div>
                <h4>Make the Simple Syrup</h4>
                    <ol>
                        <li>While the ashta cools down, make the simple syrup. In a pot over medium heat add the water, sugar, and orange blossom water.</li>
                        <li>Bring to a boil so all the sugar is dissolved and then reduce the heat to low and simmer for 10 minutes. Transfer to a bowl and allow to cool to room temperature so it thickens up a bit more.</li>
                    </ol>
            </div>
            <div>
                <h4>Prepare the Phyllo</h4>
                    <ol>
                        <li>In a food processor, pulse phyllo dough until shredded into short pieces. Do not over-pulse. Transfer to a large bowl.</li>
                        <li>Melt the butter in a small bowl and add the kanafa dye. Whisk and pour on top of the shredded phyllo dough. Mix very well to make sure all the shredded phyllo is coated in the butter evenly.</li>

                    </ol>
            </div>
            <div>
                <h4>Assemble and Cook</h4>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Prepare the kanafeh pans by brushing generously with ghee or melted unsalted butter.</li>
                        <li>Cover the whole bottom and sides with the shredded phyllo mix.</li>
                        <li>Add a generous amount of the cheese and ashta mix on top and then cover completely with the shredded phyllo mix.</li>
                        <li>Transfer over a preheated flame or flat stove top. You may need a plate for heat transfer if you have a flat stove stop.</li>
                        <li>Cook for 8 to 9 minutes until golden on one side. USe another tray that is buttered as well to flip over. Cook the other side for 8 to 9 minutes until toasted and bubbly as well.</li>
