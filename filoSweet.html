                    <p>This Filipino Flan recipe is super nostalgic for me! The egg yolks are strained twice through a cheesecloth for a wonderful creamy texture.Traditionally, leche flan is made in oval-shaped aluminum tins called Llanera, but these can be harder to find in the US.</p>

                    <h2>Puto</h2>
                    <p>Puto is a Filipino rice cake, which is traditionally wrapped in banana leaves and steamed. While it is traditionally made with rice flour or ground rice, this recipe uses regular flour for convenience and ease of preparation. Puto can be served with cheese or butter, and is most commonly eaten as a dessert or snack. Traditionally, it is eaten with dinuguan (pork blood stew), and can also be had as a morning snack with coffee.</p>

                    <h2>Taho</h2>
                    <p>Taho is another popular Filipino street food. When I visited for the first time in 2008, a vivid memory was hearing the vendors yell “TAHOOOOOOOO” along the streets of the cities. They would carry the Taho in large jugs, using sticks to leverage them over their shoulders. Taho is a mixture of silken tofu with sago pearls and sweet brown syrup.</p>

                    <h2>Tsokolate</h2>
                    <p>Tsokolate is a traditional Filipino drinking chocolate. I also have vivid memories of my lola making this in the winter for the 2 years she visited while I was growing up. Tsokolate is typically made with tablea, pure ground roasted cacao bean tablets. This rich chocolatey drink is much superior to hot cocoa, in my opinion.</p>

                    <h2>Turon</h2>
                    <p>Turon is a sweet banana based treat that is a street food favorite. This banana lumpia, or deep-fried banana rolls, are usually made with Filipino Sabo bananas which are smaller and sweeter than the typical bananas you find here in the us. Inside the wrapper, there are also thinly sliced jackfruit slices, and the rolls are then dredged in sugar and deep fried. Right before the frying is complete, the remaining sugar is added to the oil to help form the glaze coating. </p>
